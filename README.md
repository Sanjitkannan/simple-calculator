# simple-calculator
This project is a console-based simple calculator implemented in C. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

Features
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Getting Started
Prerequisites
C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
Command-line environment (Terminal, Command Prompt)
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator-c.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd calculator-c
Compile the source code using a C compiler:

bash
Copy code
gcc calculator.c -o calculator
Usage
Run the compiled executable:

bash
Copy code
./calculator
Follow the prompts to enter the operator (+, -, *, /) and two operands.

The program will output the result of the arithmetic operation.

Example
arduino
Copy code
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter two operands: 12.5 3.4
12.50 * 3.40 = 42.50
Error Handling
The program handles division by zero gracefully and invalid operator input.
